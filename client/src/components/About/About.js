      <p>
        I am a fullstack engineer living in the Bay Area. I studied through UC
        Berkeley Extension. I love learning new languages, strategies, and
        programs to expand my knowledge in the field. I have a background in
        health and hope to bring my new knowledge of programming and heath
        together.
      </p>
      <p>
        When I'm not programming, I like to hike, nap, and snack! I occasionally
        attempt at the arts of painting and knitting whenever I need a little
        time away from the monitor!
